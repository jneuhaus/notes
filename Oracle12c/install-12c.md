Notes on Oracle 12c Installation
--------------------------------

These are helper notes for migration from 11g to 12c **[see 11g notes][1]**. Much of the migration is scripted; however, since various systems (such as QA) have drifted over time, many steps are manual so that a sanity check can be performed before continuing on to the next step.
